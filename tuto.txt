----> CSS Grid
. Grid is a container with rows and cols
. Each row and column has boxes called cells
. Grid track is the space between 2 adjacent lines
. Grid item is the direct child of the grid container

. grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows prop is used to specify the number of cols and rows.

. we should use repeat and fr as values to declare the number of rows and cols.
    eg: grid-template-rows: repeat(3, 1fr) - it means, divide it into 3 parts in the 1 fraction of entire width available

. if cols > rows in the repeat function then cols has priority.
    eg: if grid-template-rows: repeat(1, 1fr) 
           grid-template-cols: repeat(4, 1fr) and items > cols then in that case, there will be 4 cols in row and rest cols will adjust in new row at the bottom of container.

. justify-self is especially for grid items and can indviduallly justofy the item.
. for vertical we use align-items
. we use place-self, place-items prop to combine align and justify
